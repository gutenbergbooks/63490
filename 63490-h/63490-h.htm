<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>Remember, boy, that behind all these men
you have to do with, behind officers, and
government, and people even, there is the
Country Herself, your Country, and that
you belong to Her as you belong to your own
Mother.</p>
</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;'><span class='it'>The Man Without a Country.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We are virtually at war. By the
time this is published, perhaps the
declaration will have been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even now, all over the country,
on this bright spring day, there are
mothers who are waiting to know what
they must do. Mothers who are facing
the day with heads up and shoulders
back, ready to stand steady when the
blow falls; mothers who shrink and
tremble, but ready, too; and other
mothers, who cannot find the strength
to give up to the service of their country
the boys who will always be little
boys to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I love my country. There is nothing
she can ask that I will not do. I am
ready to live for her or die for her.
Last stand of the humanities on earth,
realization of a dream and fulfillment
of an ideal, my home, my native land,—that
is America to me. Because I
am a woman, I cannot die for my country,
but I am doing a far harder thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am giving a son to the service of
his country, the land he loves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I was a child, I lived on a
quiet, tree-shaded street in this very
city where now I am writing this. And,
late in May of each year, when the
ailanthus trees were in blossom, the
street put up fresh curtains and red-washed
the brick pavements. The
cobblestones were swept, too. And
then the procession came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was twelve, I think, before I began
to get a lump in my throat as the
long line of veterans went by. It was
a long line then. I did not know exactly
why I cried, except that those
men and those tattered flags stood for
something heroic and very sad. I
know now, but it has taken years to
put it into words, and in those years
the line has shortened to a handful.
Even the one-armed drummer has
gone now. The street, which was rough
and hard to march on in those days,
has been made smooth for their feet,
but few are left who can march to that
quiet God’s-acre on the hill above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I know why, as a child, I wept.
Those men had fought for something
that was a part of me, like my mother,
or my home: for my country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many years later I again saw marching
men. But now the men were young,
and there were no flags and no drums.
They were marching into battle. And
they were not fighting for my country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were fighting for the ideal
on which my country was founded, for
humanity against oppression and cruelty,
for the right of a man to labor
in his own field, for the principle that
honor is greater than life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw them living and fighting, and
I saw them dying. I saw strange nations,
men of different tongues and
different colors, gathered together and
becoming as one, against a common
foe. And then I learned this: that the
world is now but one great nation,
drawn close by the creed that all men
are brothers; and that in the midst of
that great nation of the world had
broken loose something terrible, something
that must be killed, or the world
dies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once over there I saw a boy dying
in a railway station. He knew two
English words, so he said:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all right with him. He had
done his bit, and he knew that there
were others to take his place, and that
the world-nation would not rest until
the war-beast was chained. It was
“all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so now, on the brink of war, I
know it is all right with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have been the melting-pot, but
under the pot there has been no fire.
Now the fire has come, a white flame,
and we will fuse at last. But it will
burn and sear. And to that, I wonder,
can we say, “All right”?</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>War is a great adventure, the greatest
adventure in the world. The adventurers
go forth to battle, eyes ahead.
Mostly they are boys who go, because
war is the young man’s game, the
young man’s call. All over Europe
boys have left their homes, with a
shame-faced tear or two, perhaps, but
with the great adventure ahead. And
they have left at home a great emptiness,
a quiet that is not peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then,—and very suddenly,—they
have ceased to be boys on a great
adventure, and are men, fighting men,
patriots and soldiers. Something that
had always been theirs had become a
thing that had to be fought for. Not
until it was menaced had they known
how dear was their country. The flag
had been but a flag. It became a symbol
of home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have lived to see my country’s flag
beside the altar of my church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men fight wars, but it is the mothers
of a nation who raise the army. They
are the silent patriots. Given her will,
every mother in this great land would
go to war, if by so doing she could keep
her sons in safety. It is easier to go
than to send a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet war is not necessarily death. I
try to comfort myself with this. Perhaps
it will help other mothers. It is
a hazard, but it is a thing of vast rewards
and much cheerfulness, of democracy,
of big moments and little
feasts, of smiles and grumbling, of
labor and rest, and of that joy in his
own kind that only the boy knows.
And underneath it all, buried deep
and never articulate, is that feeling of
doing his bit for his country, which is
the foundation on which a nation rests
secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish I could always remember
these things. I have panicky times,
when the sun dies for me, and my
world goes black. But I am like the
other mothers. I shall go through with
it, and I would not have things otherwise.
I would not have my son do
other than he is doing. He is still in
his ‘teens, but he is a man, and this
is his country. I have not raised him
to be a shirker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only—this is a matter for everybody.
It is not my war, or his, or the
war of those other college boys who
are always the first to go. Just as we
all benefit by the country, so must we
share—and share alike—its dangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unless it is your war, this is not a
democracy. If, as in the past, we have
allowed the few to do our political
thinking for us, as even now in the
churches the few earn for all of us the
right to call this a Christian land, if in
this war we allow the few to fight for
us, then as a nation we have died and
our ideals have died with us. Though
we win, if all have not borne this burden
alike, then do we lose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, in these last troubled
days, when every newsboy on the
street under my window has been crying
War, I cover my eyes and see that
gallant little first army of England,
springing to the call, and facing,
without hope, the great trained German
army. It was the best England
had, and it is gone, almost to a man—because
the mothers of England
had not insisted that every man in the
empire bear his share.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What if now your boy and mine
could be a part of a vast trained army?
His chance would be better. Better?
There would be no war. You and I,
trembling for what may come, are
paying the price of not having risen,
an army of women, and demanded
what now may come too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because we did not rise this situation
confronts us. For this is what a
volunteer army means in this country
to-day. For every high-spirited lad
like yours and mine who goes out to
fight, there are a hundred, a thousand,
men of fighting age and strength who
will not go, men who have no country,
but only a refuge from the oppression
of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are we to suffer that they may live?
Is this liberty of ours, this Land of the
Free, without price? And will those
hold it dear whom it has cost nothing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, so great is my faith in this
great nation, so sure am I that the
principles on which it is built are enduring,
that I believe all these things
will be set right in time. The one thing
that matters now is to do our part, to
show to the world that America still
believes that there is such a thing as
honor, and such a word as right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For—and this I believe as I do in
my country—we are to end this war.
And that is the greatest privilege a nation
of the world may have. We have
sat by, through such horrors as have
turned the world to blood. But now
we can come in our strength, and
mighty strength it will be. So rich we
are! So strong! So young!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the enemy is old—jaded and
crafty and old: as old as cruelty is old.
We are young and tireless and unafraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen a sixteen-year-old Belgian
sentinel keeping watch over a
part of the German army, and all its
science was powerless against his keen
young eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we must pay the price. And the
cost falls heaviest on the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No woman has the right to hold her
son back if he desires to go to war.
It is the fruition of the years in which
she sought to make him a man. It is
the vindication of his manhood. It is
the crystallization of those very ideals
which she taught him with his prayers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I decline to believe that there are
mothers who will not let their boys
strike back when they are attacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is hard. Always the relation
between mother and son is very close.
As the boy grows up, the mother faces
this, that he needs more than she can
give him. He is still her world, but she
is no longer his. Life calls, work and
play and love, and sometimes battle.
And the mother cannot hold him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everywhere are mothers, women
who have patched small garments and
tied up little wounds, who have built
up a house of life out of millions of
loving services, whose world has been
the four walls of home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such women comes the call for
their sons, who are still to them,
though men grown, but the little boys
of the stockings, and the small wounds,
and Christmas trees, and the Fourth
of July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not fear for these women, but
we cannot minimize what they do.
They will send their sons, because they
know that a nation is but a great
home, consisting of many small ones.
Homes are the units of a nation, as
men are of an army. And these women
know that our homes are only safe so
long as the country is. They know too
that peace has fled from the earth and
cannot be brought back but by God
and the sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps my own experience will
be helpful. I am a home-woman, although
now and then my profession
has called me to strange places. Our
family life has been very close. And,
while I have little fear for myself, I
am a coward for my children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, some weeks ago, war began
to come close, I weakened, and I wrote
my oldest son a letter. I was willing to
have him do his duty, but I asked him
to wait. Womanlike, I wanted time.
I felt that surely this cross was not for
me to bear so soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then,—and may he forgive me for
telling this, because of its purpose,—after
a day or two, he wired, asking
his father and myself if we wanted him
to be a quitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came to my senses then, and the
necessary permission to enlist was
signed and sent. Then I sat down and
wrote to him, and said we would stand
squarely behind him in whatever he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Easy? It was the hardest thing I
have ever done. But I am glad now.
I would never have forgiven him, I
think, had he failed his country. But
I nearly failed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I have given one son, and I stand
ready to give my other two, if their
country needs them, when they are old
enough to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I am finding some things to
cheer me. There is, for instance, the
knowledge that the scandals of the
Southern camps during the Spanish
War will not be repeated. There we
lost ten boys from disease to every one
killed in battle. Think of it! We
learned nothing from that war, but
we have learned greatly from the war
in Europe. There will be no cruel and
useless waste of life from disease. On
the Mexican border there was practically
no sickness, although the natural
conditions were in favor of it. We
have sanitarians, now, and water supplies
will be watched. The inoculation
against typhoid, too, has eliminated
the disease, both in the European
armies and here. Because it is waste
that we fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are trying to feel, we women,
that no cost is too great, if needful
to preserve our country. But we will
never be reconciled to waste of life
through negligence. And this I promise,
now. Let such negligence occur,
and let me know of it, duly investigated,
and I will make the press of
the country ring with it, to the eternal
shame of those who are responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have been to war, and I know this:
that men living in fearful surroundings
may be kept healthy by proper care.
This care is what we demand, those of
us who cannot fight, but who are bearing
our own burdens, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One or two things have helped to
make our decision hard for us. Perhaps
the most important is this: there
is no great hatred of the enemy, however
much we abominate the things
the German Government has driven
an acquiescent people into doing. We
all know Germans here whom we like
and respect. We see them, family folk,
sober and industrious and God-fearing,
all about us. They are not Huns
or vandals. And all the knowledge we
have of a nation gone mad to order
hardly counteracts the effect of the
friendly human contacts of our daily
lives with the Germans we know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We forget that the German we know
has come here to escape the very thing
that has wrecked the old world; that in
coming to this land of the free he has
followed an ideal as steadily as back
in the fatherland his kindred are following
after the false gods of hate and war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is German, but he is not Prussian,
although he may be Prussian-born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, women know too much
now of war to enable them to make
the sacrifice easily. War has become
more than a word. It is become reality,
and only its horrors live for them.
And so far but little emphasis has
been laid on the great things for which
we will fight. We talk in numbers.
We stress the fine points of international
law. We think of bond issues
and submarines and guns—and the
women sit and roll bandages and
brood, and care little for all these
things. Why not something of the
real reason for this war, of the hatred
for ruthless cruelty, the contempt for
our rights, the scorn of the little nations,
and of the privilege of helping to
bring back to a world that is destroying
itself the priceless boon of peace?</p>

<p class='pindent'>How afraid we are of airing our love
of our country! How shame-facedly
we rise to the national anthem! How
many excuses a man will give for going
to war, except the fundamental one
that he loves his country and is going
to stick by her though the heavens fall!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little boys, these men of ours, hiding
their deepest feelings with a gibe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some things we women must learn,
and now is the time to learn them.
Sacrifice is an old story to women.
They have always known it. But not
sacrifice to an abstract ideal. Sacrifice
to an ideal, then,—and personal service.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And this personal service, mothers of
America, is not rolling bandages for the
other woman’s son.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>That hurts, but it is true. This is
no time for evasion. And it is not because
I have made my sacrifice that I
say it. It is because, unless we all give,
unless our army is large enough, those
who have failed in their duty are sending
the best youth of the country to
death. It will be murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In return for what we give, we
women of America have the right to
demand certain things. First of all we
can and must demand time that our
boys may be trained. We have taken
a long time to go into this war. And
because the country would not believe
that we must eventually be involved,
we have lost precious years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, now nearly two years ago,
I came back from the war in Europe,
I brought with me two convictions:
First, that the German Government
had thrown aside its mask of law and
order, and was following war along
lines so atrocious that it must be
checked or civilization dies. Second,
after conferring with men high in the
Allied Governments, that sooner or
later we should inevitably find ourselves
involved: it was but a matter
of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came home terrified. I tried to
talk about it. It seemed to me that we
could not sit back unarmed, with only
our brave little army,—less than a
single day’s losses in battle over there,—and
do nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was as a voice crying in the
wilderness. I was not alone, of course,
in my wilderness. There were many,
but the country heard us not. It listened
to Belgium, and sent aid. It
helped the pathetic little French orphans.
It shook its head over the Roll
of Honor in the “Illustrated London
News,” and it went to church on
Sundays and thanked God that we
were out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An obstructive Congress, instructed
from its constituencies, refused to
listen to talk of preparation. The
Army tried to get a hearing, and the
Navy tried, but both failed. It is
not the fault of the Democratic Party
that we are to-day as we are, although,
insomuch as our President is head of
the Army and of the Navy, it is the
Democratic Party which will control
the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, indeed, that stanch old
Democrat, Thomas Jefferson, who
said:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must train and classify the
whole of our male citizens and make
military instruction a regular part of
collegiate education. We can never be
safe until this is done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on he went still further:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the truth must be obvious
that we cannot be defended but by
making <span class='it'>every</span> citizen a soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the fault of a great people who
have forgotten or have never learned
that the world is only one tenth as
large as it was when this Republic was
founded. And that, instead of being
isolated from this war, the conflict is
and has been from its beginning but
just over the edge of the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What else must we demand, now
that the war-beast is creeping closer,
when his head is reared above the skyline?
What else have we a right to
ask, we women who cannot sit in the
seats of the mighty, but to whom the
nation must turn for soldiers, now and
in future generations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can ask this: This country of
ours has been hag-ridden by politics.
We have the right now to demand that
party lines be forgotten, and that the
nation act as a whole, politically; that
the best man serve, regardless of his
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This must not be a “party” war.
If any man put his party before his
country, that man is a traitor. We are
no longer Republican or Democrat or
Progressive. We are Americans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not until universal service had removed
the war in England from party
lines was there anything adequate
done. Then, and only then, did England
begin to put forth her best efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this we can ask:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>This must not be a bureaucrat’s
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Civil administration in the field has
always failed. War is a highly specialized
business, the most highly
specialized business in the world. And
we who give our best have the right to
demand the best. We can have no
bungling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English Field Marshal Wolseley,
writing of our Civil War as a
military expert, said: “The Northern
prospects did not begin to brighten
until Mr. Lincoln, in March, 1864,
with that unselfish intelligence which
distinguished him, abdicated his military
functions in favor of General
Grant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>War is not a thing for amateurs in
high places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If our own history means anything
to us, if the tragic experience of England
has taught us anything, it is that
the army in the field should not be a
Washington-controlled army, beyond
the supplying of men, arms, and equipment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know what a company commander
must do in the day’s work?
He must enroll and recruit his company
to a strength of one hundred and fifty
men. He must get them clothed,
equipped, and fed, and he must keep
them clothed, equipped, fed, doctored,
sanitated, cheerful, and amused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any woman who has tried to do all
of these things for one stirring lad may
multiply these by a hundred and fifty,
and no maternal instinct to help out,
and see that the company commander
has a full day even in peace times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he has to drill his men, and in
war he has to lead them. He must
give them every chance for life if he
can. He must die with them if it be
necessary. But he must do with them
the thing he has been assigned to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is that work for the amateur?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Mexican and Civil Wars our
professional fighters were Indian fighters
and frontiersmen, splendid and
hardy men accustomed to hardship.
But they were not conversant with
modern military methods. The result
was civilian officers, taken from shops
and offices, and the further result, in
the Civil War, that a struggle which
might have ended in a year took four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we did not learn anything from
that lesson. For we are about to commit
again the same folly, and from the
same necessity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, again, we have the right to
demand enough time. Because we
have wasted two years is no reason for
hurry now, when haste means sending
our boys untrained against a highly
trained enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know that McDowell was
urged to take his volunteers into action
by popular clamor and against
his better judgment before their three-months’
enlistment expired, and that
the result was the unhappy battle of
Bull Run?</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this means but one thing to me,
a mother. It means time to train our
boys and properly equip them. And
it means professional military leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is pertinent now, because
what we have done before we may do
again. In the Civil War each State
was called on for a certain number
of regiments. Prominent men then
raised these regiments, and they were
officered by local civilians. That was
not such a hardship then, because our
boys were to face other regiments recruited
and officered in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But surely we will not do this now. I
protest. I want the best, not only for
my son, but for all the sons who are so
valiantly offering themselves. I cannot
stand back silent, with the memories
I have of what war is, with the
death and misery and wanton destruction
of Flanders before me, with the
scar of the iron heel of Germany on my
heart. <span class='it'>I protest.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Plattsburg idea has borne
abundant fruit. It has shown three
things:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>1st. That individual training cannot
be had in less than several months
of field service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2d. That organization cannot be
had even in so short a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3d. That professional leadership is
necessary as opposed to officers appointed
from civil life at the outbreak
of hostilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You who considered prayerfully the
best doctor for your child when he
was ill, are you going now to place his
life in unskilled hands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning I stopped at one of the
recruiting stations and talked to the
clear-eyed young soldier on duty.—They
are a fine lot, this little regular
army of ours. I like to talk to them.
They look me in the eye. Do you remember
teaching your little boys to
face the world, head up?—This young
soldier had been seven years in the
army. He had one more year, and unless
there was a war, he was going to
quit then. He liked it, but he had
done his bit. No, there were not
many men applying. Yes, he guessed
we should need all we could get.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he gave me this appeal to the
young patriots of the country, flaming
now with the fire of that highest emotion
of all, love of country:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men wanted under thirty-five
years of age, for the United States
Army. Special inducements to Pharmacists,
Musicians, Bandsmen, Electricians,
Clerks, Bakers, Cooks, Barbers,
Teamsters, Carpenters, Blacksmiths,
Horseshoers, and other Mechanics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>God of our fathers! Not special inducements
to Patriots, Men who love
their country, Men who believe in
liberty, Men who hate cruelty, Men
who would avenge Belgium, Free Men,
Fighting Men!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, farther down, it is not, “Come
and do your bit,” “Your country calls
you,” or “Save the Flag.” It offers,
forsooth, “a chance to see the world.”
Those are the very words!</p>

<p class='pindent'>So to-day we are on the edge of war,
or at war. And we ask, not for boys of
fire and steel, but cooks and teamsters
and blacksmiths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the American boy has imagination,
if our War Department has not.
And he is coming, in his thousands and
tens of thousands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing can hold him back,—not
danger, not inadequate preparation,
not anything under the blue sky where
once he sailed his kites and sent up his
Fourth-of-July rockets. Not even the
mother he loves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What are we going to do, then, we
mothers, when the tumult and the
shouting have died, and the long wait
comes? We will pray. The churches
of France are full of kneeling women.
And we will work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no spectacular work for
mothers in a war. They cannot drive
ambulances, or guide aeroplanes, although
they are capable of doing both.
There will be no need of the wig-wagging
that some women are so painfully
learning! But they will work for
the Red Cross, and they will make up
such little packets as only mothers can
make,—toothbrushes and chocolates
and fresh socks and gingerbread, and
a Bible and playing-cards and cigarettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in between times, they will
wait, in that quiet that is not peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is what millions of women are
doing just now, while you are reading
this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two wars being waged to-day.
One is the war of hate, and one is
the war of love. And this last is the
bitter war, because it is being fought
in women’s hearts, between their fears
and their patriotism. I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And because fear is evil, it will go
down to defeat. Women are brave,
and mothers are the bravest of all
women, for they have faced the Gethsemane
of child-bearing. They will
not weaken now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Napoleon said, “Give me the mothers
of France, and I will make France.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>So this is how I see the situation to-day,
as it affects me and others like
me. If I believe in my country, as God
knows I do, if I love it, and that too
He knows, I must do my little part,
my bit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This the country must know: that
women are ready to do their part.
Else we are not free women, but slaves.
And this the country must know, too:
that the women demand that it do its
part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best of preparation, of skill,
of guidance, of every sort of provision,
is what we require and will have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will not fail America. Let it not
fail us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she will not. America, last
stand of the humanities on earth,
realization of a dream and fulfillment
of an ideal, our home, our native land,
we mothers stand ready.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>More than fifty-two years ago an
American woman received this letter.
It was written to one mother, but it
belongs to all mothers, everywhere in
the world, who have seen their sons go
forth to war and leave behind them
those empty places in the heart that
are never filled:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Executive Mansion</span>, <span class='it'>November 21, 1864</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>Dear Madam</span></span>: I have been shown in
the files of the War Department a statement
of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts
that you are the mother of five
sons who have died gloriously on the
field of battle. I feel how weak and
fruitless must be any words of mine
which should attempt to beguile you
from the grief of a loss so overwhelming.
But I cannot refrain from tendering to
you the consolation that may be found
in the thanks of the Republic they died
to save. I pray that our Heavenly
Father may assuage the anguish of your
bereavement, and leave you only the
cherished memory of the loved and lost,
and the solemn pride that must be
yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yours very sincerely and respectfully,</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Abraham Lincoln</span>.</p>
